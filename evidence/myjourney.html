<h1>Finding issues and fixing them </h1>

<p>A few issues that I found and fixed are listed here.</p>
    
<p>The alignment on my 'add' form looked really bad at first</p>
<img width="100%" src="images/formalign1.png"><br/>
<p>So I found out how to float the labels and input controls to make it look like this which is far easier for the user to understand</p>
<img width="100%" src="images/formalign2.png"><br/>
<p>I tested my 'details' page with an invalid reminder id.  It just failed with a blank details page meaning the user wouldn't know what happened</p>    
<img width="100%" src="images/silentfailure1.png"><br/>
<p>I added code to check the id was valid and to display an error message if it wasn't valid</p>
<img width="100%" src="images/silentfailure2.png"><br/>
<p>Testing the app out was taking a long time as I had to keep creating test data, so I created a page that set up some test reminders.  This isn't in the navigation to make sure users don't accidentally destroy their own data!</p>
