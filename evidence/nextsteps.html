<h1>Making the app better</h1>

<p>A few thoughts I had to make the app even better are listed here.</p>
    
<p>I'd like to add another property to the reminders to store the importance of each item.  This could be 'High', 'Medium' or 'Low'</p>
<p>At the moment, the reminders don't get sorted into date order - this would be a good thing to add</p>
<p>At the moment, the reminders are stored in local storage meaning that they are only available on one computer.  I would like to change the app to store the reminders in a database on the cloud so they are available everywhere.  The design I've used means that I'd only have to change the save and load functions to do this!</p>
